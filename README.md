[Flask](/what-is/flask) is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries.

### [What is a dashboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard_(business))

A dashboard is a set of pages that are easy to read and offer information to the user in real-time regarding his business. A dashboard usually consists of graphical representations of the current status and trends within an organization. Having a well-designed dashboard will give you the possibility to act and make informed decisions based on the data that your business provides - *definition provided by [Creative-Tim - Free Dashboard Templates](https://www.creative-tim.com/blog/web-design/free-dashboard-templates/?ref=appseed)*.
